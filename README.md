This is the project of custom alert written in JS(ES6) and CSS3 by Aitreya Verma.

The 'customAlert.js' file contain all the reqiured JS and the CSS , CSS is equally as important as JS in this project so plaese do not try 
to remove the CSS and change it , yes you can change the colors but please dont try to change th any other thing.

Remember to load all other scripts in which you will be reqiuring to use custum alert, and yes you should  defer this script if you
want to add this in your HTML heead tag because this script need body to be loaded before the script executes or alternatively you can
add this after a the body.

You Just need to call function "c_alert("--YOUR STRING--")", you just have to send one paramrter which in which you have to send your
text as argument.

You just not need any modificatoion in you DOM(HTML File) just add this script and youre good to go. 

I have also included a test files(Main DOM & test.js) for you to get a better understanding of a project.

THANKYOU
